# Structure

Want to run an exploratory analyses using Structure on a subset of the SNP data. 

## Whitelist.txt file

Create a list of 1000 randomly selected SNP loci for preliminary analyses.

```
#!/bin/sh
cd uoo03341/structure
cat ../output_refmap_onepop/populations.sumstats.tsv | grep -v "#" | cut -f 1 | sort | uniq | shuf | head -n 1000 > whitelist.txt
```

## Execute populations again

Rerun populations feeding back in the whitelist. 

To run populations again need to have the path (-P) going back to the stacks files (e.g. catalog.fa.gz). These can be found in the output_refmap_onepop folder.

```
#!/bin/sh
populations -P ../output_refmap_onepop/ -O ../structure/ --popmap ./popmap_haplo_nums.txt --write-single-snp --structure --whitelist whitelist.txt
```

## Running Structure

Edit the ```.structure``` output file to remove the comment line which starts with a "#". 

```
grep -v '#' populations.structure > population.structure
mv population.structure populations.structure
```

Mainparams and extraparams files in uoo03341/structure folder.

Run structure as a job:

```
#!/bin/sh
module load Structure
sbatch structure_job.sl
```

Can also run structure analyses as a loop in the job:

```
module load Structure

cd ~/uoo03341/structure/

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; 
do structure -K $i -N 183 -L 1000 -i all_ind/rm4ind/populations.structure -o all_ind/rm4ind/population1_$i; 
done 
```
(Note to self: this does not require a lot of memory, though is a long job).



This does K = 1 to K = 10. Number of individuals = -N, number of loci = -L.
Each job then can be run x10 changing name of the output file each job (i.e. ```population5_$i```) to match the number of iterations for the job.

 - *Number of loci (variant sites remained) can be found at the bottom of the corresponding populations.log file that is created after running populations**

Alternatively, can do this for the above for the 1000 SNP preliminary analysis to find optimal K value, then for final structure files (25K SNPs) only do iterations for the K +/- 1 or 2 (e.g. K=2, therefore do x10 iterations for K=2 to K=5).


## Creating structure plots with pophelper

In R. Followed instructions in manual [pophelper](http://www.royfrancis.com/pophelper/articles/index.html#plotq) and code provided online at https://github.com/royfrancis/pophelper/issues/31

# Final Structure

For structure analyses create and use whitelist of 25,000 SNPs using the above code.

When it comes to running final structure for 25K SNPs, only do iterations for the K +/- 1 or 2 (e.g. K=2, therefore do x10 iterations for K=2 to K=5) for the group/s. As this will save a lot of time.
